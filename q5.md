5-1:
#Approach1:
This function accepts an argument n. Inside this function, an empty list named res has been created. then, It loops through a sequence of numbers ranging (0 to n-1). For each number i, it computes the value of i * 2 and adds the result to the list res. Eventually, it returns the populated list res. In the outer scope, it iterates over the elements produced by calling doubleL(5), printing each element followed by a colon (:) without inserting a new line.

#Approach2:
This approach uses a list comprehension to generate a list containing doubled values of numbers in range (0 to 4). It iterates over each number n in the range and multiply it by 2. Then, it prints each doubled value followed by a colon (:) without a newline.

#Approach3:
This approach takes a parameter n. Within the function, it uses a loop to generate doubled values of numbers in range (0 to n-1). Instead of returning a list, it yields each doubled value one at a time. We use "Yield" keyword when we want to use generator function. Outside the function, it iterates over the values yielded by doubleG(5) and prints each value followed by a colon (:) without a newline.

  
5-2-1: It is a generator function.
5-2-2: lt is generating values dynamically instead of holding them all in memory simultaneously, unlike lists. We can this feature once we have a large datasets or when memory resources are limited, as it lowers memory usage and improves overall performance.
